## 3. Tables That Are Identical in Both Databases (estimated ~15 tables)

These tables have the same structure and can be migrated directly:

### Tax Strategy Tables (Likely Identical)
- `augusta_rule_details`
- `charitable_donation_details`  
- `convertible_tax_bonds_details`
- `cost_segregation_details`
- `family_management_company_details`
- `hire_children_details`
- `reinsurance_details`
- `strategy_commission_rates`

### R&D Core Tables (Likely Identical)
- `rd_areas`
- `rd_focuses` 
- `rd_roles`
- `rd_research_categories`
- `rd_subcomponents`

**Migration**: These can be copied directly with minimal transformation.

## 4. Tables That Exist in Both But Are Different (~38 tables)

### **Critical Differences - High Impact**

#### `profiles` Table
**Epic3 Structure:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE "public"."profiles" (
    id uuid PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES auth.users(id),
    email text NOT NULL,
    full_name text,
    role user_role NOT NULL,
    account_id uuid REFERENCES accounts(id) NOT NULL,
    is_admin boolean DEFAULT false,
    created_at timestamp DEFAULT now(),
    updated_at timestamp DEFAULT now()
);
```

**Main Production Structure:**
```sql  
CREATE TABLE "public"."profiles" (
    id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id uuid REFERENCES users(id),
    email text,
    full_name text,
    -- Missing: account_id, role enum, is_admin
    -- Has different FK structure
);
```

**Key Differences:**
- Epic3 links to `auth.users`, Main links to `public.users`  
- Epic3 has `account_id` (critical for account system)
- Epic3 has proper `user_role` enum, Main uses strings
- Epic3 has `is_admin` boolean

#### `clients` Table  
**Epic3 Structure:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE "public"."clients" (
    id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
    name text NOT NULL,
    account_id uuid REFERENCES accounts(id),
    partner_id uuid, -- References accounts
    has_completed_tax_profile boolean DEFAULT false,
    engagement_status engagement_status DEFAULT 'active',
    -- Additional Epic3 fields
);
```

**Main Production Structure:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE "public"."clients" (
    id uuid PRIMARY KEY,  
    name text NOT NULL,
    user_id uuid REFERENCES users(id),
    -- Missing: account_id, engagement_status enum
    -- Different relationship structure
);
```

**Key Differences:**
- Epic3 uses `account_id` system, Main uses direct `user_id`
- Epic3 has `engagement_status` enum
- Epic3 has `has_completed_tax_profile` moved from profiles
- Different partner relationship structure

### **Medium Impact Differences**

#### `tax_calculations` Table
- Epic3 likely has enhanced calculation fields
- Main has production calculation history
- Both preserve core calculation logic

#### `tax_proposals` Table  
- Epic3 has enhanced proposal workflow
- Main has production proposal data
- Different status enums and workflow states

#### `businesses` Table
- Epic3 has account-based relationships
- Main has user-based relationships
- Different foreign key structures

### **Lower Impact Differences**

#### R&D Tables (25+ tables)
Most R&D tables likely have:
- Similar core structure
- Different relationship patterns (account vs user based)
- Epic3 missing some Main production enhancements
- Main missing some Epic3 workflow improvements

Examples:
- `rd_businesses`, `rd_contractors`, `rd_employees`
- `rd_research_activities`, `rd_selected_activities`
- `rd_business_years`, `rd_contractor_year_data`

## Migration Complexity Assessment

### **High Complexity (Requires Custom Scripts)**
1. `profiles` - Fundamental architecture change
2. `clients` - Multi-user access implementation  
3. `tax_calculations` - Enhanced calculation preservation
4. `tax_proposals` - Workflow state migration

### **Medium Complexity (Schema Updates)**
5. All R&D tables - Relationship updates
6. `businesses` - Account system integration
7. `tool_enrollments` - Account-based permissions

### **Low Complexity (Direct Copy)**  
8. Strategy detail tables
9. Reference/lookup tables
10. Most calculation result tables

---

## Recommended Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (High Risk)
1. Migrate `users` â†’ `auth.users` + `accounts` + `profiles`
2. Update all FK relationships to use account system
3. Create `client_users` relationships for multi-user access

### Phase 2: Core Business Logic (Medium Risk)  
1. Migrate client and tax calculation data
2. Preserve all production calculation history
3. Update proposal workflows to Epic3 system

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features (Low Risk)
1. Migrate R&D calculation data  
2. Add Epic3's advanced features gradually
3. Enable new Epic3 capabilities

### Phase 4: Production-Specific Features
1. Evaluate Main's R&D enhancements for inclusion
2. Migrate user preferences and customizations
3. Integrate signature and document systems

---

## Data Preservation Requirements

### **Must Preserve from Main Production**
- All user accounts and authentication data
- All client relationships and data
- All tax calculations and proposals  
- All R&D credit calculations and reports
- All document signatures and approvals

### **Must Add from Epic3**
- Account-based architecture
- Multi-user client access
- Enhanced security and audit logging
- Advanced billing and subscription system
- Comprehensive analytics and monitoring

**Next Steps**: Create detailed migration scripts for each high-complexity table, starting with the user management system transformation.
