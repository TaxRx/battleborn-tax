# âœ… EXPENSE MANAGEMENT YEAR SELECTOR FIXES APPLIED

## ðŸŽ¯ **Issues Fixed**

### 1. **Year Display in Header**
- âœ… **Added year to Expense Management header**: `Expense Management (2024)`
- âœ… **Dynamic year display**: Updates automatically when year selector changes
- âœ… **Clear visual indicator**: Users can see which year they're viewing

### 2. **Year Selector Functionality**
- âœ… **Fixed year synchronization**: EmployeeSetupStep now properly syncs with parent wizard year changes
- âœ… **Automatic data reloading**: When year changes, all data (employees, contractors, supplies) refreshes automatically
- âœ… **Enhanced debugging**: Added comprehensive logging to track year changes

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Changes**

### EmployeeSetupStep.tsx
- Added `displayYear` state to track current year for header display
- Added `useEffect` to sync with `businessYearId` prop changes from parent wizard
- Modified header to show: `Expense Management ({displayYear})`
- Enhanced year change handling to automatically reload data
- Added proper initialization of display year when component loads

### RDTaxWizard.tsx
- Enhanced year selector logging for better debugging
- Year selector in header already properly configured for step 3 (EmployeeSetupStep)
- Maintains existing functionality for creating new business years when needed

## ðŸŽ® **How It Works Now**

1. **Year Selector Location**: The year selector is in the blue header bar of the RDTaxWizard
2. **Year Display**: The current year is shown in the Expense Management header: "Expense Management (2024)"
3. **Data Synchronization**: When you change the year, the page automatically:
   - Updates the header to show the new year
   - Reloads all employees, contractors, and supplies for that year
   - Refreshes all calculated QRE amounts
   - Updates all role data

## ðŸ§ª **Testing**

To verify the fixes work:
1. Navigate to the Expense Management step in the R&D Tax Wizard
2. Check that the header shows "Expense Management (YYYY)" with the current year
3. Use the year selector in the blue header bar to change years
4. Verify that:
   - The header year updates
   - Employee data refreshes for the selected year
   - Contractor and supply data updates
   - All QRE calculations refresh

## ðŸš€ **Benefits**

- **Clear Year Visibility**: Users always know which year they're viewing
- **Seamless Year Switching**: No more confusion about whether year changes took effect
- **Automatic Data Refresh**: No need to manually refresh or navigate away and back
- **Consistent UI**: Year display matches the pattern used in other wizard steps
- **Enhanced Debugging**: Better logging helps identify any future issues

## âœ¨ **User Experience**

The Expense Management page now provides a clear, intuitive experience where:
- The current year is always visible in the page title
- Year changes are immediate and obvious
- All data stays synchronized automatically
- No more wondering "did the year change take effect?"
