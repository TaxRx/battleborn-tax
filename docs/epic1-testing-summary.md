- **Session Security**: Session invalidation, concurrent session handling

### 2. Integration Testing Suite ✅
**File**: `src/tests/epic1-integration.test.ts`

- **Complete User Registration Flow**: Full workflow from signup to client creation
- **User Management Flow**: Invitation creation, management, and acceptance
- **Profile Management Flow**: Client profile updates, tax profile management
- **Data Consistency**: Referential integrity, cascade operations, concurrent operations
- **Error Handling**: Invalid data handling, database constraints, network errors

### 3. Performance Testing Suite ✅
**File**: `src/tests/epic1-performance.test.ts`

- **Authentication Performance**: Login speed, concurrent login handling
- **Database Query Performance**: Simple queries, complex joins, pagination
- **Bulk Operations Performance**: Bulk creation, updates, deletion
- **Memory and Resource Usage**: Large result sets, concurrent operations
- **Network and Latency Performance**: Network handling, parallel operations

### 4. Test Infrastructure ✅

#### Test Runner Script
**File**: `scripts/run-epic1-tests.js`
- Automated test execution

#### Test Configuration
**File**: `package.json` (updated scripts)
- `npm run test:epic1` - Run all Epic 1 tests
- `npm run test:security` - Run security tests only
- `npm run test:integration` - Run integration tests only
- `npm run test:performance` - Run performance tests only
- `npm run test:epic1:coverage` - Run with coverage reporting

### 5. Database Issues Resolution ✅

#### RLS Policy Fix
**File**: `db/bba/supabase/migrations/20250712221603_fix_rls_infinite_recursion.sql`
- Fixed infinite recursion in RLS policies
- Created helper functions for permission checking

- **Complex Queries**: < 1 second ✅
- **Bulk Operations**: < 3 seconds ✅

### Scalability Targets (All Met)
- **Concurrent Users**: 20+ concurrent operations ✅
- **Data Volume**: 1000+ records efficiently ✅
- **Memory Usage**: < 100MB increase for large operations ✅

## Security Validation

### Authentication Security ✅
- Email format validation enforced
- Strong password requirements implemented
- Duplicate email prevention working
- Invalid credential handling proper
- Session security maintained

### Authorization Security ✅
- RLS policies properly enforced
- Role-based permissions working
- Unauthorized access prevented
- Sensitive data protected
- Admin access properly controlled

### Data Protection ✅
- Password hashing implemented
- Secure token generation
- Invitation security enforced
- Audit trails maintained
- Encryption standards met

## Test Execution Results

### Environment Setup ✅
- Supabase local development environment configured
- Database migrations applied successfully
- Test data management automated
- Cleanup procedures implemented

### Test Data Management ✅
- Isolated test data for each suite
- Automatic cleanup prevents pollution
- Realistic test scenarios implemented
- Edge case coverage comprehensive

### Reporting and Monitoring ✅
- JSON test reports generated
- Pass/fail statistics tracked
- Performance metrics monitored
- Error details comprehensive

## Issues Resolved

### 1. RLS Policy Infinite Recursion ✅
**Problem**: `client_users` table policies created circular dependencies
**Solution**: Created helper functions to break recursion cycles
**Result**: All invitation functionality now working correctly

### 2. Table Access Issues ✅
**Problem**: 404 errors when accessing `client_invitations` table
**Solution**: Updated frontend to use correct `invitations` table name
**Result**: Invitation system fully functional

### 3. Permission Policy Conflicts ✅
**Problem**: Conflicting RLS policies causing access issues
**Solution**: Comprehensive policy reorganization and cleanup
**Result**: Proper access control without conflicts
