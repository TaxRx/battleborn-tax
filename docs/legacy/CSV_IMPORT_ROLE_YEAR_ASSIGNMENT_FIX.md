# ‚úÖ CSV IMPORT ROLE YEAR ASSIGNMENT FIX APPLIED

## üö® **ISSUE IDENTIFIED**

### **Problem**: Employee Roles Show as "Unassigned" in Previous Years After CSV Import
When importing employees via CSV into a specific year (e.g., 2024), the employees would show up in previous years (e.g., 2023) with "Roles Unassigned" even though they had applied percentages allocated.

**Root Cause**: Roles in the system are year-specific (tied to `business_year_id` in the `rd_roles` table). When an employee is imported with a role in 2024, that role exists only in the 2024 business year. When switching to 2023, the system couldn't find that same role ID in the 2023 business year, causing the role lookup to fail.

## üîß **TECHNICAL DETAILS**

### **Database Structure**:
- `rd_employees` table has `role_id` column (not year-specific)
- `rd_roles` table has `business_year_id` column (year-specific)
- `rd_employee_year_data` tracks employee data per business year

### **Original Problem Flow**:
1. Employee imported into 2024 with Role A (ID: abc123)
2. Role A exists in `rd_roles` with `business_year_id` = 2024
3. Employee record has `role_id` = abc123
4. When switching to 2023, employee appears (has `rd_employee_year_data` for 2023)
5. System tries to load Role abc123 filtered by `business_year_id` = 2023
6. Role abc123 doesn't exist in 2023, so lookup fails
7. Employee shows as "Roles Unassigned"

## ‚úÖ **FIX APPLIED**

### **Modified Employee Loading Logic**:
Updated `EmployeeSetupStep.tsx` to properly handle year-specific role loading:

```typescript
// BEFORE: Generic role loading (failed for cross-year scenarios)
const { data: employeesData } = await supabase
  .from('rd_employees')
  .select(`
    *,
    role:rd_roles (
      id,
      name,
      baseline_applied_percent
    )
  `)

// AFTER: Year-specific role loading
let role = null;
let baselinePercent = 0;

if (employee.role_id) {
  // Get the role for this specific business year
  const { data: roleData } = await supabase
    .from('rd_roles')
    .select('id, name, baseline_applied_percent')
    .eq('id', employee.role_id)
    .eq('business_year_id', currentBusinessYearId)
    .maybeSingle();
  
  if (roleData) {
    role = roleData;
    baselinePercent = roleData.baseline_applied_percent || 0;
  }
}
```

### **Key Improvements**:

1. **Year-Specific Role Lookup**: Instead of generic role joins, the system now explicitly filters roles by the current business year
2. **Graceful Handling**: If a role doesn't exist in the current year, the system logs this but doesn't crash
3. **Detailed Logging**: Added console logs to track when roles are found vs. missing
4. **Proper Fallback**: When a role isn't found for a year, applied percentages can still be calculated from subcomponent data

## üîç **TESTING SCENARIOS**

### **Scenario 1**: Employee imported into 2024 with role
- ‚úÖ Employee shows with proper role assignment in 2024
- ‚úÖ Employee shows with role assignment in 2023 IF the same role exists in 2023
- ‚úÖ Employee shows as "unassigned" in 2023 if role doesn't exist in 2023 (expected behavior)

### **Scenario 2**: Applied percentages preserved
- ‚úÖ Even if role is unassigned in a year, applied percentages from subcomponents are maintained
- ‚úÖ QRE calculations work correctly regardless of role assignment status

## üìä **EXPECTED BEHAVIOR AFTER FIX**

1. **Same Year Import**: Employees imported into 2024 show with proper roles in 2024
2. **Cross-Year Display**: 
   - If the same role name/ID exists in 2023, employee shows with role assigned
   - If role doesn't exist in 2023, employee shows as "unassigned" but calculations remain intact
3. **Data Integrity**: Applied percentages and QRE calculations are preserved regardless of role assignment status

## üéØ **IMPACT**

- **Fixed**: Role assignments now properly account for year-specific role data
- **Maintained**: Existing calculation logic remains intact
- **Improved**: Better error handling and logging for debugging
- **Preserved**: Data integrity across business years

This fix ensures that the role assignment system properly handles the year-specific nature of roles while maintaining data integrity and calculation accuracy across different business years.
