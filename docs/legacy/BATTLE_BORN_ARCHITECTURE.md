# Battle Born Capital Advisors - Modular Architecture

## 🎯 Overview

This document outlines the new modular architecture for the Battle Born Capital Advisors tax strategy management platform. The system has been restructured to support role-based access control while preserving the existing tax calculator functionality.

## 🏗️ Architecture Principles

### **DO NOT MESS UP THE TAX CALCULATOR**
The existing tax calculator functionality has been preserved and isolated in its own module. All tax calculation logic, components, and utilities remain intact and functional.

### Modular Design
- Clean separation of concerns
- Role-based feature isolation  
- Reusable shared components
- Scalable service architecture

### Role-Based Access Control
- **Affiliates**: Client management and proposal creation
- **Administrators**: Proposal review and system oversight
- **Clients**: View-only access to their proposals

## 🔄 Data Flow

### Proposal Workflow
```
1. Affiliate creates client profile
2. Affiliate inputs tax information
3. Tax calculator generates baseline analysis
4. Affiliate selects and configures strategies
5. System calculates projected savings
6. Affiliate creates proposal from calculation
7. Proposal submitted to admin team
8. Admin reviews and approves/rejects
9. Approved proposals assigned to experts
10. Client receives secure link to view results
```

### Database Schema (Supabase)
```sql
-- User profiles with role-based fields
profiles (
  id, email, full_name, role, 
  affiliate_code, commission_rate,  -- affiliate fields
  permissions, department,          -- admin fields
  affiliate_id, proposals          -- client fields
)

-- Client tax information
client_profiles (
  id, affiliate_id, personal_info, tax_info,
  created_at, updated_at
)

-- Tax proposals and calculations
tax_proposals (
  id, client_id, affiliate_id, status,
  baseline_calculation, proposed_strategies,
  projected_savings, admin_notes, documents,
  submitted_at, reviewed_at, approved_at
)

-- System notifications
notifications (
  id, user_id, type, title, message,
  read, created_at, action_url
)
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Current Status
The modular architecture has been implemented with:
- ✅ Core type definitions
- ✅ Authentication service
- ✅ Tax calculator module (preserved)
- ✅ Basic affiliate dashboard structure
- ✅ Admin and client placeholders
- ✅ New App.tsx entry point

### Next Steps
1. **Switch to new architecture**: Update main.tsx to use NewApp.tsx
2. **Implement affiliate components**: Client list, proposal management
3. **Build admin dashboard**: Proposal review, user management
4. **Create client view**: Secure proposal viewing
5. **Add database migrations**: Set up Supabase tables
6. **Implement notifications**: Email and in-app alerts

### Migration Path
```typescript
// Current: Original App.tsx
import App from './App';

// Future: New modular app
import BattleBornApp from './NewApp';
```
