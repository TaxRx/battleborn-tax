# ‚úÖ ROLE AUTO-COPY ACROSS YEARS FIX - IMPLEMENTED

## üö® **ISSUE REPORTED**

When employees are imported via CSV into one year with roles assigned, those roles are not available when switching to other years, causing employees to show as "Roles Unassigned" even though they have applied percentages.

**Console Log Evidence:**
```
‚úÖ Found year-specific role for Christina Gilmore: Clinical Assistant
‚ö†Ô∏è Role 431dbe90-2bb5-4cf0-a6bc-20c216d29153 not found in business year d90faae8-4949-4d24-96b9-1c45b6843912 for Makayla Stone
```

## üîß **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**

### **Database Structure Issue**:
- Roles are stored in `rd_roles` table with `business_year_id` field
- Each role is tied to a specific business year
- When employees are imported with roles in Year A, those roles only exist in Year A
- When switching to Year B, the system looks for `role_id` in Year B but finds nothing
- Result: Employee shows as "Roles Unassigned" despite having a role assigned

### **Previous Behavior**:
```typescript
// OLD: Just logged warning and continued
} else {
  console.log(`‚ö†Ô∏è Role ${employee.role_id} not found in business year ${currentBusinessYearId} for ${employee.first_name} ${employee.last_name}`);
}
```

## ‚úÖ **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**

### **Automatic Role Copy and Assignment**

**Step 1: Detect Missing Role**
- When role is not found in current year, search for it in any year
- If found elsewhere, automatically copy it to current year

**Step 2: Smart Role Handling**
- Check if role with same name already exists in current year
- If yes: Use existing role and update employee assignment
- If no: Create new role in current year with same properties

**Step 3: Update Employee Assignment**
- Automatically update employee's `role_id` to point to current year's role
- Preserve baseline percentages and role properties

### **Implementation Details**

```typescript
// NEW: Auto-fix missing roles
} else {
  console.log(`‚ö†Ô∏è Role ${employee.role_id} not found in business year ${currentBusinessYearId} for ${employee.first_name} ${employee.last_name}`);
  
  // AUTO-FIX: Try to find role in any year and copy it to current year
  const { data: anyYearRole, error: anyYearError } = await supabase
    .from('rd_roles')
    .select('*')
    .eq('id', employee.role_id)
    .maybeSingle();
  
  if (anyYearRole && !anyYearError) {
    console.log(`üîÑ Auto-copying role "${anyYearRole.name}" to current year for ${employee.first_name} ${employee.last_name}`);
    
    // Check if role with same name already exists in current year
    const { data: existingRole, error: existingError } = await supabase
      .from('rd_roles')
      .select('*')
      .eq('name', anyYearRole.name)
      .eq('business_year_id', currentBusinessYearId)
      .eq('business_id', businessId)
      .maybeSingle();
    
    if (existingRole && !existingError) {
      // Use existing role with same name
      role = existingRole;
      baselinePercent = existingRole.baseline_applied_percent || 0;
      console.log(`‚úÖ Using existing "${existingRole.name}" role in current year for ${employee.first_name} ${employee.last_name}`);
      
      // Update employee to use the existing role ID
      await supabase
        .from('rd_employees')
        .update({ role_id: existingRole.id })
        .eq('id', employee.id);
    } else {
      // Create new role in current year
      const { data: newRole, error: createError } = await supabase
        .from('rd_roles')
        .insert({
          business_id: businessId,
          business_year_id: currentBusinessYearId,
          name: anyYearRole.name,
          description: anyYearRole.description,
          type: anyYearRole.type,
          is_default: anyYearRole.is_default,
          baseline_applied_percent: anyYearRole.baseline_applied_percent,
          parent_id: null // Will be fixed in hierarchy copy if needed
        })
        .select()
        .single();
      
      if (newRole && !createError) {
        role = newRole;
        baselinePercent = newRole.baseline_applied_percent || 0;
        console.log(`‚úÖ Auto-created role "${newRole.name}" in current year for ${employee.first_name} ${employee.last_name}`);
        
        // Update employee to use the new role ID
        await supabase
          .from('rd_employees')
          .update({ role_id: newRole.id })
          .eq('id', employee.id);
      } else {
        console.error(`‚ùå Failed to auto-create role:`, createError);
        baselinePercent = anyYearRole.baseline_applied_percent || 0;
      }
    }
  } else {
    console.warn(`‚ö†Ô∏è Role ${employee.role_id} not found in any year for ${employee.first_name} ${employee.last_name}`);
    baselinePercent = 0;
  }
}
```

## üß™ **EXPECTED NEW BEHAVIOR**

### **Scenario 1: Role Already Exists in Target Year**
```
Input: Employee with "Clinical Assistant" role switching from 2024 to 2023
Action: System finds existing "Clinical Assistant" role in 2023
Result: Employee gets assigned to existing 2023 role
Log: ‚úÖ Using existing "Clinical Assistant" role in current year for John Doe
```

### **Scenario 2: Role Needs to be Created**
```
Input: Employee with "Research Scientist" role switching to year without this role
Action: System creates new "Research Scientist" role in target year
Result: Employee gets assigned to newly created role
Log: ‚úÖ Auto-created role "Research Scientist" in current year for Jane Smith
```

### **Scenario 3: Role Missing Everywhere**
```
Input: Employee with corrupted/deleted role reference
Action: System logs warning and uses 0% baseline
Result: Employee shows as unassigned but doesn't break system
Log: ‚ö†Ô∏è Role abc123 not found in any year for Bob Johnson
```
