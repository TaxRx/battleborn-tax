# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Client-Facing Portal

**Project**: TaxApp Client Portal
**Author**: BMad Product Manager
**Created**: 2025-07-08
**Version**: 1.1

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a new, secure, client-facing portal for the TaxApp application. The primary goal of this portal is to enhance the client experience by providing transparency, improving communication, and streamlining the data collection and payment processes. It will give clients a direct, secure window into their tax information.

**This project is critically dependent on the successful implementation of the Security Hardening Plan outlined in the Brownfield Architecture Document.**

## 2. User Personas

### 2.1. The Client

*   **Who they are**: An individual or business owner who has engaged with the company's tax services.
*   **Needs & Goals**:
    *   To understand the status of their tax preparation.
    *   To securely provide and update their information and documents.
    *   To easily pay for services.
    *   To access and review final reports and documents.
    *   To feel confident that their sensitive financial data is secure.
*   **Pain Points (Current State)**:
    *   Lack of visibility into the process.
    *   Manual, insecure, and inefficient communication and document exchange.
    *   Manual and disconnected payment process.
