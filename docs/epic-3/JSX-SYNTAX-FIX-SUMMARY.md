# JSX Syntax Error Fix Summary

**Date**: July 24, 2025  
**File**: `/src/modules/admin/components/tools/ToolAssignmentModal.tsx`  
**Error**: Expected corresponding JSX closing tag for `<form>` at line 673

## Issue Identified

The error was caused by an extra closing `</div>` tag at line 673 that didn't have a matching opening tag. This was disrupting the JSX structure and causing the parser to incorrectly interpret the component hierarchy.

## Fix Applied

Removed the extra closing `</div>` tag at line 673. The corrected structure now properly nests all conditional rendering blocks within the form element.

### Before:
```jsx
                </div>
              )}
            </div>    // <-- Extra closing div causing the issue
          )}

          {/* Form Actions */}
```

### After:
```jsx
                </div>
              )}

          {/* Form Actions */}
```

## Verification

- ✅ Build succeeded after fix
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passed
- ✅ Vite build completed successfully
- ✅ No JSX syntax errors remaining

## Root Cause

The issue occurred during the enhancement of the ToolAssignmentModal component when adding advanced options for subscription management. The nested conditional rendering blocks led to a mismatched closing tag being accidentally added.

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Use proper IDE JSX formatting and validation
2. Pay careful attention to nested conditional rendering blocks
3. Use React Developer Tools to validate component structure
4. Run build checks after major component modifications

The fix ensures the Tool Assignment Modal continues to function properly with all its advanced features including subscription management, usage limits, and notification settings.
