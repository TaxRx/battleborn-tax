## 2. User Stories

### Story 3.1: Admin - Partner Management
*   **As an** Admin,
*   **I want** to be able to create, view, and manage Partner accounts from my existing admin panel,
*   **So that** I can onboard new customers to our platform.

### Story 3.2: Admin - Tool Subscription Management
*   **As an** Admin,
*   **I want** to be able to assign specific tax tools to each Partner,
*   **So that** I can control their subscription level and feature access.

### Story 3.3: Partner - Workspace & Client Management
*   **As a** Partner,
*   **I want** a dedicated workspace where I can manage my own clients,
*   **So that** I can use the tax tools for my customers in an isolated environment.

### Story 3.4: Partner - Affiliate Management & Permissions
*   **As a** Partner,
*   **I want** to be able to invite my own team members (Affiliates) and set their permissions for each tool,
*   **So that** I can control how my team uses the platform.

### Story 3.5: System - Transaction Logging
*   **As a** System,
*   **I want** to automatically log a billable transaction every time a Partner uses a tax tool,
*   **So that** we have an accurate record of usage for invoicing.

### Story 3.6: Partner - Billing & Invoicing
*   **As a** Partner,
*   **I want** to be able to view my invoices and pay them securely with a credit card,
*   **So that** I can maintain my subscription to the service.
