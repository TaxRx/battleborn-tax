#### Password Security
- **Rate Limiting**: Tests password reset rate limiting (5 attempts per 15 minutes)
- **Password Strength Validation**: Validates password requirements during updates
- **Secure Password Updates**: Tests password change functionality with proper validation

#### Invitation Security
- **Secure Token Generation**: Verifies that invitation tokens are cryptographically secure
- **Invitation Spam Prevention**: Prevents multiple invitations to the same email
- **Invitation Expiration**: Tests that expired invitations are properly handled
- **Token Validation**: Ensures invalid tokens are rejected

#### Session Security
- **Session Invalidation**: Tests that logout properly invalidates sessions
- **Concurrent Session Handling**: Validates multiple concurrent sessions for the same user

### 2. Integration Tests (`epic1-integration.test.ts`)

#### Complete User Registration Flow
- **Full Registration Workflow**: Tests the complete user registration process from signup to client creation
- **Profile Creation**: Validates profile creation and data persistence
- **Client-User Relationship**: Tests the junction table relationships
- **Business Verification**: Tests business information validation and storage

#### User Management Flow
- **Invitation Creation**: Tests creating and managing user invitations
- **Invitation Management**: Tests canceling, resending, and updating invitations
- **Invitation Acceptance**: Tests the complete invitation acceptance workflow
- **Permission Verification**: Validates that accepted users have appropriate access

#### Profile Management Flow
- **Client Profile Updates**: Tests updating personal and business information
- **Tax Profile Management**: Tests creating and updating tax profiles
- **Data Validation**: Ensures all profile data is properly validated and stored

#### Data Consistency and Relationships
- **Referential Integrity**: Tests that database relationships are maintained
- **Cascade Operations**: Tests that related data is properly managed
- **Concurrent Operations**: Tests handling of simultaneous data operations

#### Error Handling and Edge Cases
- **Invalid Data Handling**: Tests graceful handling of invalid input data
- **Database Constraints**: Tests that database constraints are properly enforced
- **Network Error Handling**: Tests resilience to network issues

### 3. Performance Tests (`epic1-performance.test.ts`)

#### Authentication Performance
- **Login Speed**: Tests that login completes within 2 seconds
- **Concurrent Login Handling**: Tests 5 concurrent logins complete within 5 seconds

#### Database Query Performance
- **Simple Query Performance**: Basic client data fetch within 500ms
- **Complex Join Performance**: Multi-table joins complete within 1 second
- **Pagination Efficiency**: Paginated results load within 500ms

#### Bulk Operations Performance
- **Bulk Invitation Creation**: 100 invitations created within 3 seconds
- **Bulk Updates**: Batch updates complete within 2 seconds
- **Bulk Deletion**: Large deletions complete within 1 second

#### Memory and Resource Usage
- **Large Result Sets**: Tests handling of 1000+ records without memory issues
- **Concurrent Operations**: Tests 20 concurrent operations without resource exhaustion
- **Memory Leak Prevention**: Validates memory usage stays within acceptable limits

#### Network and Latency Performance
- **Network Latency Handling**: Tests graceful handling of network delays
- **Parallel vs Sequential Operations**: Validates performance optimization benefits

## Test Infrastructure

### Test Environment Setup
- **Supabase Local Development**: Tests run against local Supabase instance
- **Database Reset**: Clean database state for each test suite
- **Test Data Management**: Automated creation and cleanup of test data

### Test Data
- **Isolated Test Data**: Each test suite uses isolated test data
- **Cleanup Procedures**: Automatic cleanup prevents data pollution
- **Realistic Data**: Test data mirrors production scenarios

### Test Execution
- **Automated Test Runner**: `scripts/run-epic1-tests.js` executes all test suites
- **Parallel Execution**: Tests run in parallel for faster execution
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Detailed test reports with pass/fail status

## Test Results and Reporting

### Test Report Generation
- **JSON Reports**: Structured test results in JSON format
- **Pass/Fail Statistics**: Clear success rate reporting
- **Performance Metrics**: Timing data for performance tests
- **Error Details**: Comprehensive error information for failed tests

### Continuous Integration
- **Automated Execution**: Tests run automatically on code changes
- **Quality Gates**: Tests must pass before deployment
- **Performance Monitoring**: Performance regression detection

## Security Considerations

### RLS Policy Testing
- **Policy Validation**: All RLS policies are tested for proper enforcement
- **Permission Boundaries**: Tests validate that users cannot exceed their permissions
- **Admin Access**: Admin-level access is properly tested and validated

### Data Protection
- **Sensitive Data**: Tests ensure sensitive data is properly protected
- **Encryption**: Password hashing and token generation are validated
- **Audit Trails**: Security events are properly logged

## Performance Benchmarks

### Response Time Targets
- **Authentication**: < 2 seconds
- **Simple Queries**: < 500ms
- **Complex Queries**: < 1 second
- **Bulk Operations**: < 3 seconds

### Scalability Targets
- **Concurrent Users**: Support for 20+ concurrent operations
- **Data Volume**: Handle 1000+ records efficiently
- **Memory Usage**: < 100MB increase for large operations

## Test Maintenance
