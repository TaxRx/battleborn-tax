## Architecture & Design

### Component Structure
```
src/components/dashboard/
â”œâ”€â”€ ClientDashboard.tsx          # Main dashboard container
â”œâ”€â”€ StatusOverview.tsx           # Tax engagement status widget
â”œâ”€â”€ PendingActions.tsx           # Pending actions widget
â”œâ”€â”€ ActivityFeed.tsx             # Recent activity feed
â”œâ”€â”€ QuickActions.tsx             # Quick action buttons
â”œâ”€â”€ DocumentSummary.tsx          # Document status summary
â”œâ”€â”€ WelcomeHeader.tsx            # Personalized welcome section
â””â”€â”€ DashboardMetrics.tsx         # Key metrics and statistics
```

### Data Flow
```typescript
// Dashboard Data Structure
interface DashboardData {
  client: ClientInfo;
  status: EngagementStatus;
  pendingActions: PendingAction[];
  recentActivity: Activity[];
  documentSummary: DocumentSummary;
  quickActions: QuickAction[];
}

// Status Types
type EngagementStatus = 
  | 'onboarding'
  | 'data_collection'
  | 'in_progress'
  | 'review'
  | 'completed'
  | 'filed';

// Action Priority
type ActionPriority = 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
```

### Database Schema Extensions
```sql
-- Activity tracking table
CREATE TABLE client_activities (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  client_id UUID REFERENCES clients(id),
  activity_type VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  metadata JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  created_by UUID REFERENCES profiles(id)
);

-- Pending actions table
CREATE TABLE pending_actions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  client_id UUID REFERENCES clients(id),
  action_type VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  title VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  priority action_priority DEFAULT 'medium',
  due_date DATE,
  completed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Engagement status tracking
CREATE TABLE engagement_status (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  client_id UUID REFERENCES clients(id),
  status engagement_status NOT NULL,
  status_description TEXT,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_by UUID REFERENCES profiles(id)
);
```
