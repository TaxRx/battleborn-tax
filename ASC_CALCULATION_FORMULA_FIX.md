# âœ… ASC CALCULATION FORMULA FIX - IMPLEMENTED

## ðŸš¨ **ISSUE REPORTED**

The user reported that the Federal Credits section was not accurately calculating ASC (Alternative Simplified Credit), specifically that the formulas used for single-year and multi-year credits were incorrect.

## ðŸ”§ **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**

### Issue: Incorrect ASC Formula Implementation

**Problem**: The ASC calculation in `CalculationStep.tsx` was using an incorrect formula for multi-year ASC credits.

**Incorrect Formula** (before fix):
```javascript
const avgPrior3 = validPriorQREs.slice(0, 3).reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0) / 3;
const incrementalQRE = Math.max(0, qre - avgPrior3);
ascCredit = roundToDollar(incrementalQRE * 0.14);
```

**Correct Formula** (after fix):
```javascript
const avgPrior3 = validPriorQREs.slice(0, 3).reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0) / 3;
const fiftyPercentOfAvg = avgPrior3 * 0.5; // 50% of average prior 3 years
const incrementalQRE = Math.max(0, qre - fiftyPercentOfAvg);
ascCredit = roundToDollar(incrementalQRE * 0.14);
```

**Root Cause**: The formula was subtracting the full average of prior 3 years instead of 50% of the average, resulting in incorrect ASC credit calculations.

## ðŸŽ¯ **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**

### 1. **Corrected ASC Formula in CalculationStep.tsx**

**File**: `src/modules/tax-calculator/components/RDTaxWizard/steps/CalculationStep.tsx` (lines 820-850)

**Changes Made**:
- **Fixed multi-year ASC calculation**: Changed `qre - avgPrior3` to `qre - (avgPrior3 * 0.5)`
- **Added detailed logging**: Enhanced console logs to show the 50% calculation step-by-step
- **Maintained single-year and startup logic**: Kept the 6% rate for insufficient prior year data

**Correct ASC Formula Implementation**:
```javascript
// Multi-year ASC (14% rate) - CORRECTED FORMULA: 14% Ã— max(0, Current QRE - 50% of avg prior 3 years)
const avgPrior3 = validPriorQREs.slice(0, 3).reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0) / 3;
const fiftyPercentOfAvg = avgPrior3 * 0.5; // 50% of average prior 3 years
const incrementalQRE = Math.max(0, qre - fiftyPercentOfAvg);
ascCredit = roundToDollar(incrementalQRE * 0.14);
```

### 2. **Verified Consistency with Form Components**

**Verification**: Confirmed that the Form6765.tsx and Form6765v2024.tsx components already had the correct formula:

**Form6765.tsx** (pre-2024):
```javascript
const line30 = has3ConsecutiveYears ? priorQRE / 6.0 : 0; // Correct: priorQRE/6 = 50% of average
const line31 = has3ConsecutiveYears ? Math.max(totalQRE - line30, 0) : 0;
```

**Form6765v2024.tsx** (post-2024):
```javascript
lines[8].value = lines[7].value / 6.0; // line 22 = line 21 / 6.0 (Correct: 50% of average)
lines[9].value = Math.max(lines[6].value - lines[8].value, 0); // line 23 = line 20 - line 22
```

## ðŸ“Š **IMPACT OF THE FIX**

### Before Fix (Incorrect):
- **Multi-year ASC**: 14% Ã— max(0, Current QRE - Average of Prior 3 Years)
- **Result**: Significantly lower ASC credits due to subtracting too much from current QRE

### After Fix (Correct):
- **Multi-year ASC**: 14% Ã— max(0, Current QRE - 50% of Average of Prior 3 Years)
- **Result**: Accurate ASC credits that align with IRS Form 6765 requirements

### Example Impact:
- **Current Year QRE**: $1,000,000
- **Prior 3 Years Average**: $600,000
- **Before Fix**: $1,000,000 - $600,000 = $400,000 Ã— 14% = **$56,000**
- **After Fix**: $1,000,000 - ($600,000 Ã— 50%) = $1,000,000 - $300,000 = $700,000 Ã— 14% = **$98,000**
- **Difference**: +$42,000 (75% increase in ASC credit)

## ðŸ§ª **TESTING & VALIDATION**

### Enhanced Debugging:
- **Added detailed console logging** showing step-by-step ASC calculation
- **Clear formula breakdown** in logs: `qre - 50% of avgPrior3 = current - reduction = incremental * 14%`
- **Validation checks** to ensure QRE > 0 produces credit > 0

### Consistency Check:
- **CalculationStep.tsx**: Now matches Form6765 components
- **Form6765.tsx**: Already correct (using priorQRE/6.0)
- **Form6765v2024.tsx**: Already correct (using prior/6.0)

## âœ… **RESOLUTION SUMMARY**

The ASC calculation formula has been **completely corrected** in the Federal Credits section:

1. **âœ… Multi-year ASC Formula**: Now correctly uses 50% of average prior 3 years
2. **âœ… Single-year ASC**: Maintained correct 6% rate for insufficient data
3. **âœ… Startup ASC**: Maintained correct 6% rate for new businesses
4. **âœ… Enhanced Logging**: Added detailed debugging for transparency
5. **âœ… Consistency**: All components now use the same correct formula

**Result**: ASC calculations in the Federal Credits section now accurately reflect IRS Form 6765 requirements and will provide correct credit amounts for both single-year and multi-year scenarios.
