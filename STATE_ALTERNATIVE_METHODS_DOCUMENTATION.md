# State Pro Forma Alternative Calculation Methods & Validation Rules

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of alternative calculation methods and state-specific validation rules for the R&D tax credit state pro forma system. The system now supports multiple calculation pathways and comprehensive validation to ensure accuracy and compliance with state-specific requirements.

## Alternative Calculation Methods

### 1. Illinois - Simplified Method

**Availability**: Businesses with average gross receipts under $5M

**Calculation**: 
- Total QRE × 3.25% (vs. standard 6.5% of incremental QRE)

**Benefits**:
- Simpler calculation for small businesses
- No need to calculate fixed-base percentage
- Direct percentage of total QRE

**Validation Rules**:
- Gross receipts threshold: $5M
- Entity type restriction: Corporations only
- Max credit: 50% of Illinois tax liability
- Carryforward: 5 years

### 2. New York - Startup Method

**Availability**: Businesses with average gross receipts under $5M

**Calculation**:
- Total QRE × 4.5% (vs. standard 9% of incremental QRE)

**Benefits**:
- Designed for startup companies
- Eliminates complex base period calculations
- More accessible for new businesses

**Validation Rules**:
- Gross receipts threshold: $5M
- Entity type restriction: Corporations only
- Max credit: 50% of New York tax liability
- Carryforward: 15 years

### 3. Arizona - Multiple Alternative Methods

#### Simplified Method
**Availability**: Businesses with average gross receipts under $5M
**Calculation**: Total QRE × 12% (vs. standard 24% of incremental QRE)

#### Startup Method
**Availability**: Businesses with average gross receipts under $2M
**Calculation**: Total QRE × 6% (vs. standard 24% of incremental QRE)

**Benefits**:
- Two-tier system for different business sizes
- More generous rates for smaller businesses
- Refundable credits available

**Validation Rules**:
- Gross receipts thresholds: $5M and $2M
- No entity type restrictions
- Max credit: 75% of Arizona tax liability
- Carryforward: 5 years

## Validation Rules System

### Rule Types

#### 1. Max Credit Rule
- **Type**: `max_credit`
- **Purpose**: Limits credit to percentage of state tax liability
- **Example**: Illinois limits credit to 50% of tax liability

#### 2. Carryforward Limit Rule
- **Type**: `carryforward_limit`
- **Purpose**: Specifies maximum years credit can be carried forward
- **Example**: New York allows 15-year carryforward

#### 3. Apportionment Requirement Rule
- **Type**: `apportionment_requirement`
- **Purpose**: Requires apportionment factor for multi-state businesses
- **Example**: Alaska requires apportionment calculation

#### 4. Entity Type Restriction Rule
- **Type**: `entity_type_restriction`
- **Purpose**: Limits credit availability to specific entity types
- **Example**: New York and Illinois restrict to corporations only

#### 5. Gross Receipts Threshold Rule
- **Type**: `gross_receipts_threshold`
- **Purpose**: Sets minimum/maximum gross receipts requirements
- **Example**: Arizona requires minimum $1M for standard method

### Validation Rule Structure

```typescript
interface StateValidationRule {
  type: 'max_credit' | 'carryforward_limit' | 'apportionment_requirement' | 
        'entity_type_restriction' | 'gross_receipts_threshold';
  value: number;
  message: string;
  applies_to?: 'standard' | 'alternative' | 'both';
  condition?: (data: StateCreditBaseData) => boolean;
}
```

## State-Specific Configurations

### Illinois (IL)
- **Standard Rate**: 6.5% of incremental QRE
- **Alternative Rate**: 3.25% of total QRE
- **Max Credit**: 50% of tax liability
- **Carryforward**: 5 years
- **Entity Restriction**: Corporations only
- **Gross Receipts Threshold**: $1M minimum, $5M for alternative

### New York (NY)
- **Standard Rate**: 9% of incremental QRE
- **Alternative Rate**: 4.5% of total QRE
- **Max Credit**: 50% of tax liability
- **Carryforward**: 15 years
- **Entity Restriction**: Corporations only
- **Gross Receipts Threshold**: $1M minimum, $5M for alternative

### Arizona (AZ)
- **Standard Rate**: 24% of incremental QRE
- **Alternative Rate 1**: 12% of total QRE (Simplified)
- **Alternative Rate 2**: 6% of total QRE (Startup)
- **Max Credit**: 75% of tax liability
- **Carryforward**: 5 years
- **Entity Restriction**: None (available to all entities)
- **Gross Receipts Threshold**: $1M minimum, $5M/$2M for alternatives

## Implementation Features

### 1. Method Comparison
The system automatically compares standard vs. alternative methods and provides:
- Side-by-side credit calculations
- Recommendation based on higher credit
- Difference amount and percentage
- Visual indicators for optimal method

### 2. Real-time Validation
- Immediate feedback on validation errors
- Warning messages for potential issues
- Success indicators for valid calculations
- State-specific rule enforcement

### 3. Dynamic Method Availability
- Automatic detection of available alternative methods
- Business data-driven eligibility
- Clear explanation of qualification requirements
- Seamless switching between methods

### 4. Comprehensive Error Handling
- Detailed error messages
- Warning system for potential issues
- Validation state tracking
- User-friendly error presentation

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Illinois Small Business
```typescript
// Business with $3M gross receipts
const businessData = {
  wages: 500000,
  supplies: 100000,
  contractResearch: 50000,
  avgGrossReceipts: 3000000,
  businessEntityType: 'C-Corp'
};

// System automatically offers simplified method
// Standard: $42,250 (6.5% of incremental)
// Alternative: $21,125 (3.25% of total)
// Recommendation: Standard method
```

### Example 2: Arizona Startup
```typescript
// Business with $1.5M gross receipts
const businessData = {
  wages: 300000,
  supplies: 50000,
  contractResearch: 25000,

  businessEntityType: 'LLC'
};

// System offers both alternative methods
// Standard: $90,000 (24% of incremental)
// Simplified: $45,000 (12% of total)
// Startup: $22,500 (6% of total)
// Recommendation: Standard method
```
