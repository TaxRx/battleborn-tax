### Quality Assurance
- Enforce quality gates and testing standards
- Review test results and approve testing completion
- Ensure comprehensive coverage of all epic requirements
- Validate that testing meets business acceptance criteria
- Coordinate user acceptance testing with stakeholders

### Cross-Epic Integration Testing
- Plan and execute integration testing between epics
- Validate that new epics don't break existing functionality
- Coordinate regression testing across the entire application
- Ensure testing covers all user role interactions and workflows
- Validate system-wide performance and scalability
