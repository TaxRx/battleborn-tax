## Git Workflow Framework

### Branch Strategy Architecture

#### Main Branch Structure
```
main (production)           # Always production-ready, protected
├── develop (integration)   # Integration branch for features
├── epic/* (major features) # Long-running feature branches
├── feature/* (features)    # Short-lived feature branches
├── hotfix/* (urgent fixes) # Hotfix branches from main
└── release/* (releases)    # Release preparation branches
```

#### Branch Naming Conventions
- **Main Branches**: `main`, `develop`
- **Epic Branches**: `epic/user-authentication`, `epic/dashboard-enhancement`
- **Feature Branches**: `feature/tax-calculator-optimization`, `feature/commission-tracking`
- **Hotfix Branches**: `hotfix/security-patch-v1.2.1`, `hotfix/critical-calculation-fix`
- **Release Branches**: `release/v1.3.0`, `release/v2.0.0-beta`
- **Bugfix Branches**: `bugfix/login-validation-error`, `bugfix/report-generation-timeout`

### Commit Message Standards

#### Conventional Commit Format
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

<body>

<footer>
```

#### Commit Types
- **feat**: New feature for users
- **fix**: Bug fix for users
- **docs**: Documentation changes
- **style**: Code style changes (formatting, semicolons, etc.)
- **refactor**: Code refactoring without functional changes
- **perf**: Performance improvements
- **test**: Adding or updating tests
- **chore**: Maintenance tasks, build changes, etc.
- **security**: Security-related changes
- **db**: Database schema or migration changes

#### Example Commit Messages
```

```

### Feature Development Workflow

#### Feature Branch Lifecycle
1. **Branch Creation**: Create feature branch from latest develop
2. **Development**: Regular commits with clear messages
3. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing including unit, integration, and E2E
4. **Code Review**: Peer review and approval process
5. **Integration Testing**: Test integration with develop branch
6. **Merge**: Strategic merge back to develop with appropriate strategy

#### Epic Branch Management
- **Long-term Features**: Major features that span multiple sprints
- **Integration Point**: Integration point for related feature branches
- **Testing Coordination**: Comprehensive testing across epic features
- **Milestone Tracking**: Track epic progress and completion milestones
- **Merge Strategy**: Careful merge to develop with comprehensive testing

### Merge Strategies & Conflict Resolution

#### Merge Strategy Selection

##### Merge Commit (Default for Epic/Release branches)
```bash
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff epic/user-authentication
```
- **Use When**: Major features, epic completions, release merges
- **Benefits**: Clear history, preserves context, easy rollback
- **Commit Message**: Comprehensive description of merged functionality

##### Squash Merge (Small features, cleanup)
```bash
git checkout develop
git merge --squash feature/small-ui-fix
git commit -m "feat(ui): improve button styling and accessibility"
```
- **Use When**: Small features, multiple small commits, cleanup
- **Benefits**: Clean history, single logical commit
- **Requirements**: Comprehensive squash commit message

##### Rebase Merge (Linear history preference)
```bash
git checkout feature/tax-calculation-fix
git rebase develop
git checkout develop
git merge --ff-only feature/tax-calculation-fix
```
- **Use When**: Want linear history, small features
- **Benefits**: Linear history, no merge commits
- **Caution**: Changes commit hashes, avoid on shared branches

#### Conflict Resolution Process

##### Pre-merge Conflict Prevention
1. **Regular Sync**: Regularly sync feature branches with develop
2. **Communication**: Coordinate changes in shared files
3. **Modular Development**: Minimize overlapping changes
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing before merge attempts

##### Conflict Resolution Steps
1. **Understand Changes**: Thoroughly understand both sides of conflict
2. **Consult Authors**: Discuss conflicts with original authors if needed
3. **Test Resolution**: Test resolved conflicts thoroughly
4. **Validate Functionality**: Ensure resolution maintains all functionality
5. **Document Resolution**: Document complex conflict resolutions

## Release Management

### Release Branch Workflow

#### Release Preparation
```bash
# Create release branch from develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b release/v1.3.0

# Version bump and preparation
npm version minor  # Updates package.json
git add package.json package-lock.json
git commit -m "chore(release): bump version to 1.3.0"

# Final testing and bug fixes in release branch
# Only bug fixes, no new features
```

#### Release Completion
```bash
# Merge to main with tag
git checkout main
git merge --no-ff release/v1.3.0
git tag -a v1.3.0 -m "Release version 1.3.0"

# Merge back to develop
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff release/v1.3.0

# Clean up release branch
git branch -d release/v1.3.0
git push origin --delete release/v1.3.0
```

### Hotfix Workflow

#### Critical Production Fix
```bash
# Create hotfix branch from main
git checkout main
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-security-patch

# Implement fix and test thoroughly
# ... development and testing ...

# Version bump for patch
npm version patch
git add package.json package-lock.json
git commit -m "chore(hotfix): bump version to 1.3.1"

# Merge to main
git checkout main
git merge --no-ff hotfix/critical-security-patch
git tag -a v1.3.1 -m "Hotfix version 1.3.1 - Critical security patch"

# Merge to develop
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff hotfix/critical-security-patch

# Deploy immediately to production
```

## Advanced Git Operations

### Interactive Rebase for Commit Cleanup
```bash
# Clean up commits before merge
git rebase -i HEAD~3

# Squash, reword, or reorder commits
# Use to create clean, logical commit history
```

### Cherry-picking for Selective Merges
```bash
# Apply specific commit to another branch
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>

# Use for applying hotfixes to multiple branches
# Or backporting specific features
```

### Stash Management for Work-in-Progress
```bash
# Save work-in-progress when switching branches
git stash push -m "WIP: tax calculation optimization"

# Apply stashed work later
git stash pop
```
