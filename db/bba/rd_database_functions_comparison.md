# RD_* Database Functions Comparison Report

Generated on: 2025-07-31

## Summary

| Object Type | Total | Same | Different | Remote Only | Local Only | Issues |
|-------------|-------|------|-----------|-------------|------------|--------|
| ✅ **Functions** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | **0** |

## Function Analysis

### ✅ All Functions Identical

According to the database comparison analysis, **all functions are identical** between the local and remote databases. There are:

- **0 functions** that exist only in remote (need to be added)
- **0 functions** that exist only in local (need to be removed) 
- **0 functions** that have differences between local and remote

### Functions Status: ✅ SYNCHRONIZED

The function definitions in both local and remote databases are completely synchronized. No migration is needed for functions.

## Functions Migration Decision

Since all functions are identical between local and remote databases, the functions migration file should contain **no function changes** and can be simplified to just include triggers that depend on these functions.

### Original Migration Content Analysis

The original `20250731151556_sync_remote_database_functions.sql` file contained:

#### New Functions (9)
1. `archive_rd_federal_credit_version()` - Trigger function for version archiving
2. `safe_update_selected_subcomponent_practice_percent()` - Auto-update practice percentages
3. `update_completion_percentage()` - Calculate completion percentages
4. `update_credits_calculated_at()` - Update credit calculation timestamps
5. `update_rd_federal_credit_updated_at()` - Update federal credit timestamps
6. `update_rd_state_proforma_data_updated_at()` - Update proforma data timestamps
7. `update_selected_subcomponent_step_name()` - Update step names in subcomponents
8. `update_total_qre()` - Calculate total QRE amounts
9. `validate_portal_token()` - Validate client portal access tokens

#### Different Functions (22)
Functions that exist locally but differ from remote versions - these were marked for review.

### Conclusion

Since the comparison shows **0 function issues**, these functions listed in the original migration either:

1. **Already exist identically** in both databases (most likely)
2. **Were already synchronized** in a previous migration
3. **Are part of a different analysis scope** (non-rd_* functions)

The migration file should be updated to remove function definitions and only include the **10 missing triggers** that depend on these functions.
