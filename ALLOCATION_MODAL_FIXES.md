# ✅ ALLOCATION MODAL FIXES APPLIED

## 🚨 **ISSUES IDENTIFIED AND RESOLVED**

### **1. Revert to Baseline Not Working Properly** ❌➡️✅
**Problem**: The "revert to baseline" functionality was only deleting custom allocations and resetting UI state, but not properly recalculating and updating the employee/contractor year data (QRE and applied percentages) to baseline values.

**Root Cause**: The revert function was missing the crucial step of recalculating baseline QRE values and updating the `rd_employee_year_data` and `rd_contractor_year_data` tables.

**Fix Applied**: 
- **Employee Modal**: Added comprehensive baseline QRE recalculation that:
  - Fetches employee wage and role baseline percentage
  - Calculates baseline QRE: `Math.round((annualWage * baselinePercent) / 100)`
  - Updates `rd_employee_year_data` with baseline values
  - Includes detailed logging for debugging

- **Contractor Modal**: The contractor modal already had proper baseline recalculation, including:
  - Uses contractor's `baseline_applied_percent` 
  - Calculates full QRE: `Math.round((contractorAmount * baselinePercent) / 100)`
  - Applies 65% reduction for contractors: `Math.round(fullQRE * 0.65)`
  - Updates `rd_contractor_year_data` with baseline values

### **2. Research Activity Removal Changes Not Saved** ❌➡️✅
**Problem**: When users disabled/removed research activities from allocations, the changes weren't being saved to the database. The save function only processed enabled activities (`if (activity.isEnabled)`), leaving disabled activity allocations in the database.

**Root Cause**: The save function logic was incomplete - it handled enabled activities but ignored disabled ones, meaning their subcomponent allocations persisted in the database even when the activity was disabled.

**Fix Applied**:
- **Employee Modal**: Added pre-processing step that:
  - Loops through all activities first
  - For disabled activities (`!activity.isEnabled`):
    - Gets all subcomponent IDs for the disabled activity
    - Deletes all allocations for those subcomponents from `rd_employee_subcomponents`
    - Includes logging for debugging
  - Then proceeds with normal save logic for enabled activities

- **Contractor Modal**: Applied identical fix for contractor allocations:
  - Same logic but deletes from `rd_contractor_subcomponents` table
  - Handles disabled activities before processing enabled ones

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS**

### **Employee Modal Changes** (`EmployeeSetupStep.tsx`):

#### Revert to Baseline Enhancement:
```typescript
// Added comprehensive baseline recalculation
const { data: employeeData } = await supabase
  .from('rd_employees')
  .select('annual_wage, role:rd_roles(baseline_applied_percent)')
  .eq('id', employee.id)
  .single();

const baselineQRE = Math.round((annualWage * baselinePercent) / 100);

await supabase
  .from('rd_employee_year_data')
  .update({
    calculated_qre: baselineQRE,
    applied_percent: baselinePercent,
    updated_at: new Date().toISOString()
  })
  .eq('employee_id', employee.id)
  .eq('business_year_id', businessYearId);
```

#### Save Allocations Enhancement:
```typescript
// Added disabled activity handling
for (const activity of activities) {
  if (!activity.isEnabled) {
    const subcomponentIds = activity.subcomponents.map(sub => sub.id);
    
    if (subcomponentIds.length > 0) {
      await supabase
        .from('rd_employee_subcomponents')
        .delete()
        .eq('employee_id', employee.id)
        .eq('business_year_id', businessYearId)
        .in('subcomponent_id', subcomponentIds);
    }
  }
}
```

### **Contractor Modal Changes** (`ContractorAllocationsModal.tsx`):

#### Save Allocations Enhancement:
```typescript
// Added identical disabled activity handling for contractors
for (const activity of activities) {
  if (!activity.isEnabled) {
    const subcomponentIds = activity.subcomponents.map(sub => sub.id);
    
    if (subcomponentIds.length > 0) {
      await supabase
        .from('rd_contractor_subcomponents')
        .delete()
        .eq('contractor_id', contractor.id)
        .eq('business_year_id', businessYearId)
        .in('subcomponent_id', subcomponentIds);
    }
  }
}
```

## 📊 **VERIFICATION STEPS**

### **Test Revert to Baseline**:
1. Open allocation modal for employee/contractor
2. Make changes to allocations (modify percentages, toggle activities)
3. Click "Revert to Baseline"
4. Verify:
   - ✅ QRE calculations match role baseline percentages
   - ✅ Applied percentages reset to baseline values
   - ✅ All custom allocations are removed from database
   - ✅ Employee/contractor year data reflects baseline values

### **Test Activity Removal**:
1. Open allocation modal
2. Disable/remove research activities (set `isEnabled: false`)
3. Click "Save Allocations"
4. Verify:
   - ✅ Database no longer contains allocations for disabled activities
   - ✅ Enabled activities are saved correctly
   - ✅ QRE calculations only include enabled activities

## 🔍 **DEBUGGING AND LOGGING**

Both fixes include comprehensive console logging:
- `🔄` Revert to baseline operations
- `🗑️` Disabled activity removal operations  
- `💾` Save operations for enabled activities
- `✅` Success confirmations
- `❌` Error handling with details

## 🎯 **IMPACT**

These fixes ensure:
1. **Baseline Integrity**: Revert to baseline now properly restores mathematical calculations to original role-based values
2. **Data Consistency**: Disabled activities are properly removed from database, preventing ghost allocations
3. **User Experience**: Changes are saved accurately, matching user intentions
4. **Calculation Accuracy**: QRE values always reflect current allocation state

The allocation modals now properly handle both enabling/disabling activities and reverting to baseline scenarios with full mathematical accuracy.
