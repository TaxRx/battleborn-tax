          <p>
            To claim the R&D tax credit, your company must meet certain criteria. Specifically, your company
            engaged in qualified research activities that met the following requirements:
          </p>
          <p>
            With your assistance, we applied these and other qualifying criteria to your business activities to develop

            <li>
              The research was undertaken for the purpose of discovering information that is technological in nature.
              There is no requirement to discover new information for your industry; the application of technology or
              systems that are new to your business is sufficient.
            </li>
            <li>
              The information being sought was intended to be useful in the development of a new or improved business
              component. A business component is a process that is important to the viability of your business.
            </li>
            <li>
              The research involved a process of experimentation. This means that you engaged in a systematic process
              to evaluate your protocols or products to achieve a result.

          <ul className="filing-process-list" style={{ listStyle: 'disc', paddingLeft: 20 }}>

          <p>
            If your company is an eligible small business, you may elect to apply the R&D tax credit against your
            payroll taxes instead of your income taxes. To be eligible for this election, your company must have gross
            receipts of less than $5 million for the current tax year and no gross receipts for any tax year preceding
            the 5-year period ending with the current tax year. If your company meets these criteria, you can elect to
            apply the R&D tax credit against your payroll taxes for up to five years.
          </p>
          <p>
            Making this election can be a valuable tool for eligible small businesses, as it can provide a significant
            cash flow benefit. However, it is important to note that once you make this election, you cannot claim the
            R&D tax credit against your income taxes for that tax year.

        {/* 4. IRC Section 280C Election */}
        <div className="qre-table-section">
          <h3 className="filing-guide-section-title">4. IRC Section 280C Election</h3>
          <p>
            IRC Section 280C(c)(3)(B) is an important provision for companies that are claiming the R&D tax credit and
            wish to take a reduced credit in lieu of adding back Section 174 expenses. This provision allows companies
            to elect to reduce their R&D tax credit by the amount of their Section 174 expenses that are taken as a
            deduction in the tax year.
          </p>
          <p>
            Section 174 expenses are expenses related to research and experimental activities that are deductible in the
            year they are incurred. However, under the general rule for calculating the R&D tax credit, these expenses
            must be added back to the qualified research expenses (QREs) used to calculate the credit.
          </p>
          <p>
            By making the election under Section 280C(c)(3)(B), companies can avoid adding back these expenses and
            instead reduce their R&D tax credit by the same amount. This can result in a smaller credit, but it can also
            simplify the calculation process and reduce the risk of errors.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is important to note that this election is not available to all companies. To be eligible, a company must
            have gross receipts of less than $50 million for the prior tax year and meet certain other criteria.
            Additionally, once a company makes this election, it cannot switch back to the general rule for calculating
            the credit in future years.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the 280C(c)(3) election is not made, taxable income must be increased by making an adjustment to Schedule
            M-3 or Schedule M-1. Schedule M-1 is required for taxpayers with total receipts and total assets that are
            $250,000 or greater.
          </p>
          <ul className="filing-process-list" style={{ listStyle: 'disc', paddingLeft: 20 }}>
            <li>For partnerships and S-corporations, this adjustment to taxable income is generally reported on line 4 of Schedule M-1.</li>
            <li>For corporations, this is generally adjusted on line 5 of Schedule M-1.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Please work with your CPA to determine whether this election is beneficial for you. An election under IRC
            Section 280C(c)(3)(B) to claim the reduced credit can only be made on a timely filed return, including
            extensions. It is impermissible to make this election on an amended return filed after such due date.
